# Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Models (Full Implementation)
1. User.java - Complete with authentication, roles, teams
2. Team.java - Complete with members and capacity management
3. Category.java - Complete with hierarchy support
4. Comment.java - Complete with attachments and editing
5. Attachment.java - Complete with file metadata
6. SLA.java - Complete with time tracking

## 🔄 In Progress
Currently implementing remaining models, repositories, services, controllers, and UI components.

## Strategy
Given the large number of files (60+), I'm implementing them in priority order:
1. Core Models (Domain objects) - IN PROGRESS
2. Repositories (Data access layer)
3. Services (Business logic layer)
4. Controllers (UI controllers)
5. FXML Views (User interface)
6. Utilities and Configuration

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining models (Workflow, KnowledgeBase, Notification, Metric, AuditLog)
- Implement all repositories with Neo4j queries
- Implement all services with business logic
- Implement all controllers with JavaFX bindings
- Create comprehensive FXML views
