- **Configuration**: Robust application and database settings management.

### **2. INTELLIGENT FEATURES (100% COMPLETE)**
- **AI Service**: Natural Language Processing for automatic ticket categorization and priority suggestions.
- **Search Service**: Semantic search capabilities across Tickets and Knowledge Base articles.
- **Workflow Engine**: Automated rule-based triggers (e.g., auto-assignment, notification on SLA breach).
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time performance tracking and system health monitoring.

### **3. USER INTERFACE (100% COMPLETE)**
- **Controllers**: 14 JavaFX controllers connecting the UI to the business logic.
